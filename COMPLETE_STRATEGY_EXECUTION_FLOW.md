## 📋 **STRATEGY OVERVIEW**

**Direct IOC Box Strategy** - 4-leg sequential box execution with intelligent market observation and dual entry/exit strategies.

---

## 🏗️ **INITIALIZATION PHASE**

### **1. Strategy Setup**

```
StratergyDirectIOCBox.__init__(paramsid)
├── Redis connection setup
├── Load configuration (lot sizes, users)
├── Initialize execution tracker & helpers
├── Set execution mode (LIVE/SIMULATION)
├── Load parameters from Redis (4_leg:{paramsid})
├── Set profit thresholds & desired spreads
│   ├── profit_threshold_sell: 2 Rs
│   ├── profit_threshold_buy: 2 Rs
│   ├── desired_spread: 405 (entry)
│   └── desired_exit_spread: 200 (exit)
└── Initialize background threads
```

### **2. Leg Configuration & Pairing**

```
_init_legs_and_orders()
├── Load bidding leg + 4 base legs
├── Automatic leg pairing based on BUY/SELL actions
│   ├── Pair 1: BUY legs [pair1_bidding_leg, pair1_base_leg]
│   └── Pair 2: SELL legs [pair2_bidding_leg, pair2_base_leg]
├── Determine exchange (BFO/NFO/NSE)
├── Setup user tracking data
├── Create order templates (entry + exit)
└── Initialize pricing & calculation helpers
```

### **3. Global Parallel Observation Setup**

```
_init_global_parallel_observation()
├── Start BUY_PAIR observation thread
├── Start SELL_PAIR observation thread
└── Continuous market monitoring for strategic execution
```

## 🎯 **MAIN EXECUTION FLOW**

### **ENTRY PHASE**

#### **Step 1: Execution Trigger**

```
_execute_both_pairs(uid, prices)
├── Check if desired quantities already reached
├── If complete → SUCCESS
└── If incomplete → Continue to dual strategy
```

#### **Step 2: Market Observation & Decision**

```
_execute_dual_strategy_pairs(uid, prices)
├── Identify leg pairs:
│   ├── BUY legs: [pair1_bidding_leg, pair1_base_leg]
│   └── SELL legs: [pair2_bidding_leg, pair2_base_leg]
├── 10-second dedicated observation on BUY legs
├── Decision Logic:
│   ├── BUY legs STABLE → CASE A (SELL first)
│   └── BUY legs MOVING → CASE B (BUY first)
└── Route to appropriate case execution
```

#### **Step 3A: CASE A - SELL Legs First**

```
_execute_case_a_sell_first(uid, prices, buy_leg_keys, sell_leg_keys)
├── Use global observation for SELL leg execution order
├── Execute SELL legs (MODIFY strategy):
│   ├── First SELL leg → MODIFY until complete
│   └── Second SELL leg → MODIFY until complete
├── Calculate remaining spread for BUY legs:
│   └── remaining_spread_for_buy = desired_spread + sell_executed_spread
├── Validate BUY spread condition
├── Execute BUY legs (IOC strategy):
│   ├── Create spread condition checker
│   └── Execute both BUY legs with IOC + retry
└── Success → All legs executed
```

#### **Step 3B: CASE B - BUY Legs First**

```
_execute_case_b_buy_first(uid, prices, buy_leg_keys, sell_leg_keys, buy_observation)
├── Confirm BUY market conditions with global observation
├── Execute BUY legs (MODIFY strategy):
│   ├── First BUY leg → MODIFY until complete
│   └── Second BUY leg → MODIFY until complete
├── Calculate remaining spread for SELL legs:
│   └── remaining_spread_for_sell = buy_executed_spread - desired_spread
├── Validate SELL spread condition
├── Execute SELL legs (IOC strategy):
│   ├── Create spread condition checker
│   └── Execute both SELL legs with IOC + retry
└── Success → All legs executed
```

#### **Step 4: Profit Monitoring (Parallel)**

```
During execution, continuous monitoring:
├── _monitor_sell_profit_and_execute_buy()
│   ├── Monitor SELL profit vs threshold (2 Rs)
│   ├── If profit reached → Trigger exit
│   └── Otherwise → Continue BUY execution
└── _monitor_buy_profit_and_execute_sell()
    ├── Monitor BUY profit vs threshold (2 Rs)
    ├── If profit reached → Trigger exit
    └── Otherwise → Continue SELL execution
```

---

## 🔄 **EXIT PHASE**

### **Exit Trigger Points**

```
Exit can be triggered by:
├── _execute_sell_exit(uid) → Profit threshold reached on SELL
├── _execute_buy_exit(uid) → Profit threshold reached on BUY
└── Manual exit trigger
```

### **Step 1: Exit Initialization**

```
_execute_exit_both_pairs(uid, prices)
├── Check if positions exist to exit
├── Get fresh exit prices (with bid/ask reversal)
└── Route to dual strategy exit execution
```

### **Step 2: Exit Market Observation & Decision**

```
_execute_dual_strategy_exit_pairs(uid, prices)
├── Identify EXIT leg pairs (REVERSED from entry):
│   ├── EXIT BUY legs: [pair2_bidding_leg, pair2_base_leg] (close SELL positions)
│   └── EXIT SELL legs: [pair1_bidding_leg, pair1_base_leg] (close BUY positions)
├── 10-second dedicated observation on EXIT BUY legs
├── Decision Logic:
│   ├── EXIT BUY legs STABLE → EXIT CASE A (SELL first)
│   └── EXIT BUY legs MOVING → EXIT CASE B (BUY first)
└── Route to appropriate exit case
```

### **Step 3A: EXIT CASE A - SELL Legs First**

```
_execute_exit_case_a_sell_first(uid, prices, exit_buy_leg_keys, exit_sell_leg_keys)
├── Use global observation for EXIT SELL leg execution order
├── Execute EXIT SELL legs (MODIFY strategy):
│   ├── First EXIT SELL leg → MODIFY until complete (close BUY position)
│   └── Second EXIT SELL leg → MODIFY until complete (close BUY position)
├── Calculate EXIT BUY execution with desired_exit_spread
├── Execute EXIT BUY legs (IOC strategy):
│   ├── Create spread condition checker with exit spread
│   └── Execute both EXIT BUY legs with IOC + retry (close SELL positions)
└── Success → All positions closed
```

### **Step 3B: EXIT CASE B - BUY Legs First**

```
_execute_exit_case_b_buy_first(uid, prices, exit_buy_leg_keys, exit_sell_leg_keys, exit_buy_observation)
├── Confirm EXIT BUY market conditions with global observation
├── Execute EXIT BUY legs (MODIFY strategy):
│   ├── First EXIT BUY leg → MODIFY until complete (close SELL position)
│   └── Second EXIT BUY leg → MODIFY until complete (close SELL position)
├── Calculate EXIT SELL execution with desired_exit_spread
├── Execute EXIT SELL legs (IOC strategy):
│   ├── Create spread condition checker with exit spread
│   └── Execute both EXIT SELL legs with IOC + retry (close BUY positions)
└── Success → All positions closed
```

## ⚙️ **EXECUTION STRATEGIES**

### **MODIFY Strategy (First Pair)**

```
_place_modify_order_until_complete() / _place_modify_exit_order_until_complete()
├── Place initial order with current price + tick
├── Monitor order status continuously
├── If partial fill → Modify price and continue
├── Repeat until complete fill (max 30 attempts)
└── Reliable execution for first pair
```

### **IOC Strategy (Second Pair)**

```
_place_ioc_order_with_retry() / _place_ioc_exit_order_with_retry()
├── Check spread condition before each attempt
├── Place IOC order (500ms timeout)
├── If not filled → Retry with new price
├── Repeat up to max retries
└── Fast execution for second pair
```

---

## 🎮 **PRICING LOGIC**

### **Entry Pricing**

```
BUY orders  → Use ASK prices (pay ask to buy)
SELL orders → Use BID prices (receive bid when selling)
Spread: desired_spread (e.g., 405)
```

### **Exit Pricing (Reversed)**

```
EXIT BUY orders  → Use ASK prices (pay ask to close SELL positions)
EXIT SELL orders → Use BID prices (receive bid to close BUY positions)
Spread: desired_exit_spread (e.g., 200)
```

---

## 🔄 **EXECUTION MODES**

### **LIVE Mode**

```
└── Real order placement via API
```

### **SIMULATION Mode**

```
└── Simulated orders with Redis storage
```

---

## 📊 **MONITORING & TRACKING**

### **Continuous Monitoring**

```
├── Global parallel observation (BUY_PAIR, SELL_PAIR)
├── Execution tracking with milestones
├── Profit monitoring with thresholds
├── Spread condition checking
└── Quantity tracking (entry vs exit)
```

### **Logging & Debugging**

```
├── Comprehensive execution logs
├── Error handling with traceback
├── Redis-based execution tracking
└── Performance monitoring
```

---

## 🎯 **COMPLETE LIFECYCLE**

```
🚀 INIT → 📊 OBSERVE → 🎯 ENTRY → 💰 MONITOR → 🔄 EXIT → ✅ COMPLETE

1. Strategy initializes with parameters and leg configuration
2. Global parallel observation starts for market monitoring
3. Entry execution with CASE A/B decision based on 10-second observation
4. MODIFY strategy for first pair (reliable) + IOC strategy for second pair (fast)
5. Continuous profit monitoring during and after execution
6. Exit execution triggered by profit thresholds or manual trigger
7. Exit uses same logic but with reversed leg assignments and exit pricing
8. Complete position closure with MODIFY/IOC exit strategies
```
