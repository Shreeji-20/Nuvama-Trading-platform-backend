# Global Observer Duplicate Initialization Fix

## Problem Identified

The global observer was being started **twice** in the strategy execution:

1. **First call**: In `__init__()` method at line 67

   ```python
   # Initialize legs and order templates
   self._init_legs_and_orders()

   # Start global parallel observation
   self._init_global_parallel_observation()  # ← FIRST CALL
   ```

2. **Second call**: In `main_logic()` method at line 1094
   ```python
   # Initialize global parallel observation
   self.logger.info("Initializing global parallel observation system")
   self.execution_tracker.add_milestone("Global observation initialization started")
   self._init_global_parallel_observation()  # ← SECOND CALL (DUPLICATE)
   ```

## Root Cause

- The initialization was happening during object construction (`__init__`)
- Then again when `main_logic()` was called
- This caused **duplicate background threads** for the same observation pairs
- Led to **resource waste** and potential **race conditions**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Duplicate Prevention Check

Updated `_init_global_parallel_observation()` to check if already initialized:

```python
def _init_global_parallel_observation(self):
    """Initialize global parallel observation for both pairs at startup."""
    try:
        # Check if already initialized to prevent duplicate initialization
        if self.global_observation_active:
            self.logger.warning("Global parallel observation already active, skipping initialization")
            return  # ← EARLY RETURN TO PREVENT DUPLICATES

        # ... rest of initialization code
```

### 2. Enhanced Thread Existence Check

Updated `_start_global_parallel_observation()` to check for existing threads:

```python
def _start_global_parallel_observation(self, observation_key, leg1_key, leg2_key):
    """Start global parallel observation that runs throughout strategy execution."""
    try:
        # Check if observation thread already exists for this key
        if observation_key in self.global_observation_threads:
            existing_thread = self.global_observation_threads[observation_key]
            if existing_thread.is_alive():
                self.logger.warning(f"Global observation thread already running for {observation_key}")
                return  # ← PREVENT DUPLICATE THREADS
```

### 3. Modified main_logic() Verification

Changed `main_logic()` from **forcing initialization** to **verifying status**:

```python
# BEFORE (caused duplicates):
self._init_global_parallel_observation()

# AFTER (verification only):
if not self.global_observation_active:
    self.logger.warning("Global observation not active, attempting to initialize")
    self._init_global_parallel_observation()
else:
    self.logger.success("Global parallel observation system already active")
```

## Test Results ✅

**Verification Test Results:**

- ✅ PASS: `_init_global_parallel_observation` called correct number of times (2 total)
- ✅ PASS: `_start_global_parallel_observation` called correct number of times (2 total)
- ✅ PASS: Correct number of observation threads created (2: BUY_PAIR, SELL_PAIR)
- ✅ PASS: Global observation remains active throughout execution

## Benefits of Fix

### 1. **Resource Efficiency**

- **Before**: 4 observation threads (2 duplicates)
- **After**: 2 observation threads (optimal)

### 2. **Thread Safety**

- Eliminates race conditions from duplicate observers
- Prevents conflicting observation results
- Ensures single source of truth for market data

### 3. **Performance Improvement**

- Reduced CPU usage from unnecessary threads
- Lower memory footprint
- Faster observation result retrieval

### 4. **Debugging Clarity**

- Clear logging when duplicates are prevented
- Easier to trace execution flow
- Better error diagnostics

## Execution Flow (Fixed)

```
Strategy.__init__()
├── Load configuration
├── Initialize legs and orders
└── _init_global_parallel_observation()  ← Starts 2 threads (BUY_PAIR, SELL_PAIR)

Strategy.main_logic()
├── Verify global observation is active  ← Checks existing status
├── ✅ Already active, skip initialization
└── Proceed with trading execution
```

## Backward Compatibility ✅

- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All existing method signatures preserved
- Strategy execution logic unchanged
- Enhanced error handling and logging

The fix ensures **single initialization** of the global observer system while maintaining all existing functionality and improving system reliability.
