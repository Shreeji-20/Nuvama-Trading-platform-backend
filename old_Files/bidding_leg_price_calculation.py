# YOUR PARAMETERS EXAMPLE:

        "symbol": "NIFTY",
        "strike": 24700,
        "type": "PE",

    },
    "leg1": {"action": "SELL", "price": 28},   # 24300 CE SELL
    "leg2": {"action": "BUY", "price": 150},   # 24300 PE BUY  
    "leg4": {"action": "BUY", "price": 205},   # 24700 CE BUY

# BIDDING LEG PRICE CALCULATION FORMULA:
"""
The bidding leg price is calculated as:
bidding_leg_price = desired_spread - sum_of_3_other_legs_prices

Where:
- desired_spread = Target spread value (405 in your case)
- sum_of_3_other_legs = Calculated sum of leg1, leg2, leg4 considering their actions

STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION:

1. Calculate other legs sum considering actions:
   - BUY legs: ADD to sum (positive)
   - SELL legs: SUBTRACT from sum (negative)
   
   other_legs_sum = -leg1 + leg2 + leg4  (considering actions)
                  = -28 + 150 + 205 = +327

2. Calculate bidding leg price based on its action:
   
   For SELL bidding leg (your case):
   desired_spread = other_legs_sum - bidding_leg_price
   405 = 327 - bidding_leg_price
   bidding_leg_price = 327 - 405 = -78
   
   Since price can't be negative: bidding_leg_price = abs(-78) = 78
   
   For BUY bidding leg (alternative):
   desired_spread = other_legs_sum + bidding_leg_price  
   405 = 327 + bidding_leg_price
   bidding_leg_price = 405 - 327 = 78

# EXECUTION LOGIC:
execution_logic = {
    "pair1_execution": {
        "condition": "If bidding_leg is in pair1",
        "price_calculation": "Use calculated bidding leg price",
        "other_leg_price": "Use market price",
        "example": "If bidding_leg + leg1 in pair1, bidding_leg uses calculated price (78)"
    },
    
    "pair2_execution": {
        "condition": "If bidding_leg is in pair2", 
        "price_calculation": "Use calculated bidding leg price",
        "skip_tolerance": "Execute immediately (no price tolerance check)",
        "example": "If bidding_leg + leg4 in pair2, bidding_leg uses calculated price (78)"
    },
    
    "non_bidding_legs": {
        "price_source": "Market prices from Redis depth data",
        "tolerance_check": "Apply price tolerance if not bidding leg",
        "execution": "Standard market-based execution"
    }
}

# ADVANTAGES:
advantages = [
    "Precise spread targeting: Ensures exact desired spread achievement",
    "Market-independent: Bidding leg price calculated, not market-dependent", 
    "Automatic adjustment: Adapts to changing market prices of other legs",
    "Action-aware: Considers BUY/SELL actions in calculation",
    "Flexible pairing: Works regardless of which pair contains bidding leg"
]
